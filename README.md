# des2taxonindex
Open-source R code to compute the DES-T (Taxon) index from the Dissociative Experiences Scale II (Carlson &amp; Putnam, 1993; Waller et al., 1996). Use with caution, as the validity of the DES-T has been questioned (Leavitt, 1999; Merritt &amp; You, 2006; Modestin &amp; Erni, 2004).
